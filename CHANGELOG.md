# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `synology_disk_smart` never returned SMART attributes. `disk_smart_info()` queried `SYNO.Core.Storage.Disk/get_smart_info`, which does not exist on DSM 6 or 7, and its DSM 6 fallback called `SYNO.Storage.CGI.Smart/get` **without forwarding `extra_params`** — asking DSM for SMART data without naming a disk. On DSM 7.3.2 the tool returned error 103; on DSM 7.1.1 it returned `success: true` with an empty `hddinfo`, so a monitoring caller saw "no problems" from a query that never looked at a drive. The attribute table now comes from `SYNO.Storage.CGI.Smart/get_smart_info` keyed by the disk's **device path** (`device=/dev/sata1`); a bare name is rejected by DSM with error 117, so `disk_id` accepts either the id (`sata1`, `sda`, `nvme0n1`) or a full `/dev` path and is normalized, falling back to a `disk_list()` lookup when the two diverge. Verified against DSM 7.1.1-42962 (DS214play) and DSM 7.3.2-86009 (RS822RP+), returning 19–20 attributes per drive.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Container Manager support** — ~30 new MCP tools for Synology DSM Container Manager (Docker), spanning containers (list/get/start/stop/restart/delete/logs/resource), compose projects (list/get/create/update/start/stop/restart/build/clean/delete), images (list/get/delete/pull), registries (list/search/tags/download), and networks (list/get/create/delete). They reuse the existing per-NAS session caching and multi-NAS targeting, and destructive operations require explicit names. The `synology-nas` Agent Skill gains a Container Manager domain (`references/containers.md`, GHCR + runtime-DNS gotchas, and an eval). Thanks @denisdasilvarocha. (#44)
- `synology_container_logs` exposes `offset`/`limit` pagination (defaults `0`/`1000`, bounded `offset >= 0` / `limit >= 1`) instead of a hardcoded 1000-line query. (#46, #49)

### Fixed
- `synology_logout` now evicts **all** per-domain service-instance caches (health, container, NFS, user management), not just FileStation/DownloadStation, so no stale instance lingers on a dead session — and the same applies to the graceful expired-session path. That branch now coerces the DSM error code with `str()` before matching, so DSM's **numeric** `105`/`106` (returned via JSON) hit the cleanup path instead of falling through to the failure branch. (#48, closes #47)
- `update_project` JSON-encodes the service-portal name/protocol consistently with `create_project`, so portal-config updates reach DSM correctly; `_project_id` tolerates non-dict project payloads instead of raising on lookup. (#44)

### Changed
- Container Manager API versions are typed as `int` to match `SynologyAPIClient.post()`, and `list_registry_tags` routes its v2 call through a named `registry_tags_version` field instead of a bare literal. (#45, #50, #49, #51)
- Extracted a single `_service_instance_dicts()` helper so session login, relogin, logout, and cleanup all evict the same canonical cache set. (#48)
- Dependency bumps: `mcp` `>=1.28.0`, `mcp-proxy` `>=0.12.0`, `pytest` `>=9.1.1`, and `actions/checkout` to v7. (#39–#43)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Optional HTTP/SSE transport for remote deployments via `docker-compose.http.yml` (mcp-proxy). The extra dependency is isolated in `requirements-http.txt` and only installed when the image is built with `INSTALL_HTTP=1`/`true`; the default stdio/Xiaozhi image is unchanged. (#25, #36)

### Fixed
- Transparent recovery from DSM error 119 ("SID not found"). When a server-side session expires — typically after ~1h of inactivity on `SYNO.Core.*` APIs — `SynologyAPIClient` now re-authenticates with the cached credentials and retries the call once instead of failing until the process restarts. The relogin is concurrency-safe (serialized per NAS, so simultaneous 119s collapse into a single new session rather than leaking orphaned SIDs) and resyncs `mcp_server`'s cached SID/token and lazily-built service instances, so a later logout targets the live session. A failed auth-module import on the recovery path is now logged instead of silently swallowed. (#27, #37)

### Changed
- Hardened the HTTP/SSE Docker build and isolated the mcp-proxy dependency from the core image. (#36)
- Bumped `mcp` to `>=1.27.2` and `pytest-asyncio` to `>=1.4.0`. (#26, #28)
- CI: gate `@claude` and PR-review workflows to trusted users, support fork PRs via `pull_request_target`, and skip Dependabot/fork runs where appropriate. (#29–#33)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- `system_info`: use `SYNO.DSM.Info` version 2 as fallback on DSM 7.x — version 1 is below `minVersion` and returns error 104; `SYNO.DSM.Info/getinfo/v2` returns model, serial, DSM version string, RAM, temperature, and uptime successfully. Thanks @leto1210. (#17)

### Changed
- Hardened Claude Code workflows: skip runs on bot-triggered events, add `id-token: write` for claude-code-action OIDC, refresh Dependabot config with PR limits and labels, and add label-sync + issue-triage workflows. (#18, #19)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- `synology-nas` Anthropic Agent Skill at `skills/synology-nas/` — teaches Claude how to use the MCP tools effectively (multi-NAS targeting, aggregate health checks, path conventions, per-domain workflows for files/downloads/health/NFS/users). Works in Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and claude.ai. (#14, closes #5)
- Claude Code `@claude`-mention reviewer workflow on PRs. (#15)

### Fixed
- CI now checks out the PR head SHA on `issue_comment` triggers so commit-aware reviews work. (#16)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- DSM 7.3.2+ CSRF support: capture `SynoToken` at login (`enable_syno_token=yes`), thread `X-SYNO-TOKEN` through every service module, default session type changed to `webui`. Older DSM (6.x, 7.0–7.2) ignore the flag and continue to work header-less.

### Fixed
- `synology_create_share` on DSM 7.3.2 — `SYNO.Core.Share.create` now sends a JSON-encoded `shareinfo` envelope plus a top-level JSON-encoded `name`. Verified against DSM 7.3.2-86009 Update 3. (#8)
- Silent loss of `additional` field data on DSM 7.3.2 — now sent as JSON arrays in `FileStation.list_directory`, `FileStation.get_file_info`, and `DownloadStation.list_tasks`. Thanks @CynicalTyr. (#7)
- `FileStation.create_file` upload now threads `X-SYNO-TOKEN` on the direct `requests.Session().post(...)` path.

### Tests
- New regression test pinning the `create_share` wire format.
- Repaired 11 stale `test_config` tests broken by an earlier `SECRETS_FILE` → `SETTINGS_FILE` rename.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Unified `settings.json` configuration replacing `secrets.json` — single file for NAS credentials, Xiaozhi, and server settings. Uses XDG path `~/.config/synology-mcp/settings.json`. Supports multiple NAS devices.
- Centralized logging via Python's `logging` module with configurable levels (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR), set in `settings.json`.
- Lint configuration in `pyproject.toml` (Ruff, Black, mypy). Codebase reformatted with Black.

### Security
- File permission enforcement: refuses to load settings with insecure permissions (e.g. 0644).
- README guidance on using dedicated accounts without 2FA.
